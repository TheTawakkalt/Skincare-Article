          Skin care is a range of practices that support skin integrity, enhance
          its appearance, and relieve skin conditions. They can include
          nutrition, avoidance of excessive sun exposure, and appropriate use of
          emollients. Practices that enhance appearance include the use of
          cosmetics, botulinum, exfoliation, fillers, laser resurfacing,
          microdermabrasion, peels, retinol therapy, and ultrasonic skin
          treatment. Skin care is a routine daily procedure in many settings,
          such as skin that is either too dry or too moist, and prevention of
          dermatitis and prevention of skin injuries.

          Sun protection is an important aspect of skin care. Though the sun is
          beneficial in order for the human body to get its daily dose of
          vitamin D, unprotected excessive sunlight can cause extreme damage to
          the skin. Ultraviolet (UVA and UVB) radiation in the sun's rays can
          cause sunburn in varying degrees, early ageing and an increased risk
          of skin cancer. UV exposure can cause patches of uneven skin tone
          and dry out the skin. It can even reduce skin's elasticity and
          encourage sagging and wrinkle formation.
